<h2>Terms of Use</h2>

<p>
  Genevieve and the GenNotes server are personal projects of Madeleine Ball,
  whose work is supported with funding from the Shuttleworth Foundation.
</p>

<p>
  By using this, you agree to the following terms.
</p>

<h3>Administration</h3>

<p>
  Genevieve is currently administered by Madeleine Ball. Administrators have
  access to Genevieve operations and private data. If Madeleine Ball chooses
  to add additional administrators to Genevieve's operations, the site will be
  updated to describe these.
</p>

<h3>Data use and privacy</h3>

<p>
  Using the Open Humans API, Genevieve will have access to read your genetic
  data and Open Humans username.
</p>

<p>
  Your genetic data will be used to generate a report. With the exception of
  data management within service providers used by this project (e.g. cloud
  services for the web server), individual private genetic data will not be
  shared with third parties. Individual report information generated from
  private genetic data will be private.
</p>

<p>
  However if original data is publicly shared in Open Humans, this data and/or
  a resulting report may be publicly shared by Genevieve. Furthermore, other
  information (e.g. username) associated with the public genetic data in Open
  Humans may be associated with the public report shared by Genevieve.
</p>

<h3>Disclaimers</h3>

<p>
  Genevieve analysis may contain errors, and may be discontinued at any time.
  This is described in more detail in the <a href="{% url 'about' %}">"About"</a>
  page.
</p>

<p><i>
  Genevieve is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind, express or
  implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability,
  fitness for a particicular purpose, and noninfringement.
</i></p>
