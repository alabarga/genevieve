<h3>Genevieve is for personal exploration and education.</h3>
<p>
  I believe access and discussion of knowledge is a right and necessity for
  informed citizenry in the age of genomics. Thus, I want to facilitate
  personal exploration and education with access to published claims regarding
  the effects of variants in an individual genome, and enable discussion and
  consensus understanding of these claims.

  <b>Genevieve is NOT intended to be used as a clinical device for diagnosis or
  detection of disease.</b> If you find information in Genevieve that appears to
  indicate something clinically important, you should work with a health care
  provider (e.g. <a href="http://www.nsgc.org/">genetic counselor</a>) that can
  review, verify, and determine if clinical action is warranted.
